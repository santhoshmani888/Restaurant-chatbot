Restaurant chatbot using JESS

Food On Chat (FOC)rule-based expert system is designed using JESS Rules and can answer
questions based on some rules on which it is trained on. Restaurants use chatbots for
customer service to answer simple questions, help users order food online, track current
order, get more information on menu, etc. Having a chatbot help expedite this type of tasks,
allows human agents to focus on more complex problems related to customer service. At the
same time a chatbot allows the company to have a 24/7 service to attend to their customerâ€™s
needs.
